This example illustrates the basic usage\r\nof oKDE-java.\r\n\r\nTo use oKDE-Java in another project just include the jar file (see above [how to build](#build)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ext_libs\">\r\n## External Libraries Used\r\n\r\nThe following libraries are used in oKDE-Java:\r\n *  [EJML](https://code.google.com/p/efficient-java-matrix-library/),\r\n \ta linear algebra library for manipulating dense matrices\r\n \tLicense: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"license\">\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jonas Luthke\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
