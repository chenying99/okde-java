oKDE-Java
=========

This is a Java *implementation* of the oKDE algorithm proposed by Matej Kristan, 
see http://www.vicos.si/Research/Multivariate_Online_Kernel_Density_Estimation.

Given a set of samples (n-dimensional points), this algorithm estimates the distribution of the samples using
kernel density estimation. The output model is a *Mixture of Gaussians*.
Moreover, the model is compressed and can be updated as new samples arrive.

The basic principle of the oKDE algorithm is summarized by this graphic:
